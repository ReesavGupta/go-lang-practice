	// now what happens in the main func is that since there are 5 values in the buffered channel the we start to read the values off the channel with a second of delay sugggesting that we are doing some work which takes a second

	// but when we use a unbuffered channel what happens is we add a value to the buffer and we read the value out of it concurrently. which makes the rest of the process function wait.
	// If the channel were unbuffered, the sender (process()) would block on each send until the receiver (channels()) reads it â€” making it a synchronous handshake.
